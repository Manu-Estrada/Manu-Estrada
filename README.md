<!--
**Manu-Estrada/Manu-Estrada** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
I am currently attending a Bootcamp of 850 hours of programming and web development, taught by Factoria F-5 in GijÃ³n (Principality of Asturias), which has started in October 2022 and whose completion is scheduled for April this year.
I come from working in the hospitality industry for a long working life, in which of my more than 31 years of contributions, only 4 of them have been in a different guild, in the security sector.
In Hospitality I have reached great personal achievements and great professional positions.
The wear and tear in this type of work and the poor quality of life, have led me to decide to study this intensive course in which I have been involved and I hope to finish successfully, and with the expectation of being able to find work in one of its many branches.
